Book-Exchanger-Web
The AIM is to provide a web app wherein students can easily exchange,buy or sell books. We presume a lot of students struggle to find the required books according to their college syllabus. Itâ€™s hard to gather notes from different online sites and libraries because of their high costs. So, we have created a mobile app and web app wherein students can easily exchange books in mutual understanding with each other. It works in association with our Book-exchanger-app
